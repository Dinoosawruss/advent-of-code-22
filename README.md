# Advent of Code 2022

## My solutions

Note:
This year I am doing advent of code to try and improve my style in python and write good quality, readable code with comments, etc.
I will aim to do at least one solution to each problem with, what I feel is, good quality and readable code and may come back to problems that are more interesting to build better and more optimal solutions.

### Day 1: Calorie Counting


### Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors


### Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization
